functions pointers for blockdirect move and directmove
block movement is hella ineffiencent 
Color Red Block R2,R3,R1 Created a bigger Block R2,R3,R1 in L19
Color Red Block R2,R3,R1 moves from L22 to L19 in counter clockwise dir


since the mystery cell is said to be having no peices at the start but if a peice lands on it and can't move it should it remain in the mystery cell? the problem with this is when a new peice enters the cell it if it's a oppoent peice it'll be treated the same if it's the same player it would create a block and would it teleport the whole block or just the individual

problem at count 22281 is the block gets moved to the base which makes,
    the name null
